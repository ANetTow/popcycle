[SeaFlow](https://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/tools/seaflow/) is a new environmental flow cytometer designed by the [Armbrust lab](https://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu) to be deployed on oceanographic research vessels to monitor continuously photosynthetic microorganisms. Since its first deployment in 2008, the [SeaFlow](https://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/tools/seaflow/) instrument has collected over 200,000 samples in surface waters of the North Pacific and Atlantic Ocean. The geographical distribution of marine phytoplankton, their optical characteristics (size and pigment content), and their dynamics in relation to environmental factors are of major interest for the oceanographers. 

Unlike a conventional flow cytometer, [SeaFlow](https://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/tools/seaflow/) directly analyzes a raw stream of seawater using two detectors that determine the position of the particle in the focal region of the instrument optical system ([Swalwell et al. 2011](https://doi.org/10.4319/lom.2011.9.466)). With this technology, measurements from particles that pass through the ideal focal position of the collection optics can be differentiated from improperly positioned particles, producing a measurement equivalent to that obtained with a conventional cytometer (see [OPP filtration](https://github.com/armbrustlab/seaflow-filter)). The ratio of these optimally positioned particles (OPP) to the total detectable particles is used to retrieve the volumetric flow rate, allowing accurate estimation of cell abundances (see [virtual core calibration](https://github.com/armbrustlab/seaflow-virtualcore)). Each particle is defined by its light scatter and by two different wavelengths of fluorescence associated with chlorophyll pigment (690 nm for red fluorescence) and phycoerythrin pigment (570 nm for orange fluorescence), which allow the discrimination between cells and detritus or suspended sediments and between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organisms. 

Here we introduce *Popycle*, an R package that uses a database management system approach to facilitate the analysis of [SeaFlow](https://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/tools/seaflow/) data. The software performs 3 key analysis:

1. Classification of phytoplankton cell population using a mixture of manual gating or semi-supervized clusterting algorithm
2. Convert light scattering of each particle to [carbon content](https://github.com/armbrustlab/fsc-poc-calibration) and [cell diameter](https://github.com/armbrustlab/fsc-size-calibration)
3. Perform aggregate statistics for the different populations

SeaFlow data are stored in a custom binary file format (EVT file) created every 3 minutes and consist of eight 16-bit integer channels. The acquisition time, stream pressure of each sample and metadata provided by the ship's data system (e.g., time, location, sea surface temperature, salinity, light intensity) are written into a log file ([SFL file](https://github.com/armbrustlab/seaflow-sfl)). The files are stored in julian day labeled directories, each containing EVT files and an SFL file. The cell population identification, diameter and carbon content of each OPP are saved as separate text files (VCT files) in simialr file structure as EVT files. The metadata, gating scheme and aggregated statistics for each step are saved into a SQL database using SQLite3.
